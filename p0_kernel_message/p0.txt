Project 0 - Kernel Mod
2 Feb 2020

Modified files:
---------------
(1) /usr/rep/src/linux-hwe-5.0.0/init/main.c


Changes made:
-------------
(1) I added a procedure call to "printk" after the excess memory was deallocated but before the call to end the early boot phase/start init was made. This call prints to the kernel console, so as its parameter I put the string that I wanted to print with my name and UFID. The procedure "printk" writes into the kernel's boot buffer.


Testing:
--------
I tested to make sure the project works by first creating a diff file. I then saved that file and restored the VM to its clean state. Upon booting the clean image, no special boot messages were displayed. I then applied the diff file to the kernel source, and after re-compiling and rebooting, the message was successfully displayed.
